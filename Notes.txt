equals() contract!!

Compile-time constant:
final variables that must be declared and initialized in the same line.
Switch only accepts Compile-time constant; The values must be: integers, except long, them wrappers, String and enum

Doesn't matter where case labels are placed.. Them acts like doors..
Case labels can't be duplicated

Switch discarts decimals values defining constants.

Watch out for the annonimous block inside if's

Labeled statements:
■ You can add labels to a code block defined using braces, {}, all looping statements (for, enhanced forloop, while, do-while), conditional constructs (if
and switchstatements), expressions and assignments, returnstatements, try
blocks, and throwsstatements.
■ You can’t add labels to declarations of variables.
■ You can use a labeled breakstatement to exit an outer loop. 
■ You can use a labeled continuestatement to skip the iteration of the outer loop.
