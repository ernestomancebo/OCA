equals() contract!!

Compile-time constant:
final variables that must be declared and initialized in the same line.
Switch only accepts Compile-time constant; The values must be: integers, except long, them wrappers, String and enum

Doesn't matter where case labels are placed.. Them acts like doors..
Case labels can't be duplicated

Switch discarts decimals values defining constants.

Watch out for the annonimous block inside if's

Labeled statements:
■ You can add labels to a code block defined using braces, {}, all looping statements (for, enhanced forloop, while, do-while), conditional constructs (if
and switchstatements), expressions and assignments, returnstatements, try
blocks, and throwsstatements.
■ You can’t add labels to declarations of variables.
■ You can use a labeled breakstatement to exit an outer loop. 
■ You can use a labeled continuestatement to skip the iteration of the outer loop.

NOTE When you try to access an invalid array position, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. When you try to access an invalid ArrayList position, IndexOutOfBoundsExceptionis thrown.

Exception hierarchy!!!! ****

ExceptionInInitializerError can  be  caused  by  an  object  of
RuntimeExceptiononly. It can’t occur as the result of an error or checked
exception thrown by the staticinitialization block.

Don’t  confuse  the  exception  thrown  by Class.forName(),  used  to
load  the  class,  and NoClassDefFoundErrorthrown by the JVM. Class.forName()throws ClassNotFoundException.
